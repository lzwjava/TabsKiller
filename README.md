## Story

I usually open many tabs. So I press Ctrl+W to close them a lot, one at a time. Repeat and repeat. I wanted to write an extension to solve my problem. Then I found "Tab Wrangler" which closes tabs when inactive for x minutes — I learned from it and built one that closes the oldest tabs when you exceed your limit. With URL locking for important tabs. It helps me a lot. Tabs never become too many. Hope you like it too.
