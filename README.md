## Story

I usually open many tabs in Chrome. So I press Ctrl + W to close them a lot one time. Repeat and repeat. So I want to write an extension to solve my problem. Then I found “Tab Wrangler” extension which close tabs when x minutes not active. I learned from it. and make a extension to close the oldest tabs when more than x tabs. And lock some tabs whose url matches some pattern. It helps me a lot. I just do not need to take care of tabs any more. Tabs never become too many. It ease my life. Hope you like it so.

## Install

Because my visa credit card could not make Google Payment, I haven't uploaded it to the Chrome store. But as the source code is open, to install it is easy. 

First, go to <a href="chrome://extensions">chrome://extensions</a>, then select the developer mode, and then load unpacked extension. It's done.

中文：

因为中国的 visa 卡不能用于 Google 支付，我暂时还没上传到 Chrome 商店里。但既然代码开源了，安装还是很容易的。首先，点击右边的 Download ZIP 下载源代码及解压，然后打开<a href="chrome://extensions">chrome://extensions</a>，选择`开发者模式`，然后点击`加载已解压的扩展程序`，像上面的图一样。接下来会弹出一个文件选择框，选择刚刚下载的源代码目录。这样就安装了这个插件了。
