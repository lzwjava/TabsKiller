I usually open many tabs in Chrome. So I press Ctrl + W to close them a lot one time. Repeat and repeat. So I want to write an extension to solve my problem. Then I found “Tab Wrangler” extension which close tabs when x minutes not active. I learned from it. and make a extension to close the oldest tabs when more than x tabs. And lock some tabs whose url matches some pattern. It helps me a lot. I just do not need to take care of tabs any more. Tabs never become too many. It ease my life. Hope you like it so.
